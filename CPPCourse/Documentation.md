## Definition
For the course a very simple card guesser based on numbers was made. This guesser works in the terminal and has some very basic inputting, file saving and file reading. 

## Planning
### Environment details
The program was made in visual studio 2022 by using the standard windows commandline project and has been tested/run on windows multiple times.
### Planning details
The project is a very basic beginners CPP project made over the course of 8 weeks that handles basic inputs and has a functional game loop.

## implementation
The app was created from scratch without a header file so the order of functions is based on what is compiled first rather then what is easier to read.
Classes were out of scope for this project so everything is in singular file with no extra classses or seperation. Functions were used to provide some form of better readability.

## Testing
### Initial testing
To make sure the app works as intended it was tested during development by the developer so all prominent issues could easily be fixed without any delay.
### Testing by others
I'm sad to say that I ran out of time so this project has not been tested by anyone else then me.
